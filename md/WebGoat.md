I would like to metion that I will be using **Burpsuite** instead of **OWASP ZAProxy**
for the majority of the tasks. Please feel free to follow the tutorials provided by
WebGoat if you are not comfortable with this tool.

# Introduction

## WebGoat

### Task 1

No answer needed.

## WebWolf

### Task 1

No answer needed.

### Task 2

No answer needed.

### Task 3

Type in your e-mail address below and check your inbox in WebWolf. Then type in the unique code from the e-mail in the field below.

How to access the Mailbox:

1. Go to `http://localhost/WebWolf/login`.
2. Log in with your WebGoat credentials.
3. Navigate to "MailBox" in the top toolbar.

Go back to Web**Goat** and enter an email with the following pattern:

```
Pattern: <username>@<doesn't matter>
Example: leastsignificantbit@canliterallybeanything.lmao
```

Go back to the mailbox and copy the code from the received email.
The code for the above email is:

```
tibtnacifingistsael
```

### Task 4

This task seems to be optional.
The answer is the same code from *Task 3*.

Just click on the link and enter any password.
Alternatively, visit the following URL manually:

```

An explanation of the individual headers:

- `Host` -> This is the websites host. In this case `localhost` as the application is hosted locally.
- `User-Agent` -> Contains some basic information about the program that is being used to interact with the website. This may help with displaying the website correctly.
- `Accept` -> This is the media type that the browser will accept in the response.
- `Accept-Language` -> This is the language/s that the browser will accept in the response.
- `Accept-Encoding` -> These are the different types of encoding that the browser will accept in the response.
- `Content-Type` -> Describes what format is used to send data to the server. Only used in POST/PUT requests.
- `Origin` -> Enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, allowing a client to access otherwise restricted resources from a different domain then the resource is hosted on.
- `Connection` -> Decides whether the connection with the web server should be held open or be closed.
- `Referer` -> The URL at which the client was located when sending the request.
- `Cookie` -> Contains one or more cookie/s previously set by a `Set-Cookie` header by the server. Cookies have multiple purposes from serving as credentials to preventing basic brute force attacks and more.
- `Sec-Fetch-Dest` -> Can be used to let the server know what the response will be used for. This can help with formatting the reponse for the expected use case on the server.
- `Sec-Fetch-Mode` -> This header is used to distinguish between different uses for the response, for example whether it is for a user navigating a website or to load an image and so on.
- `Sec-Fetch-Site` -> Through this header, a client can tell the server whether a request is coming from the site itself, from a different site or from a completely user-generated request.

WebGoat is using **Javascript** and **Java 17/Maven**.

Exposed Javascript frameworks:

- Backbone.js 1.4.0
- RequireJS 2.3.6

Exposed Javascript Libraries:

- jQuery 3.5.1
- jQuery UI 1.10.4
- Underscore.js version unknown

The name if the input field used to for the task is `changeMe`.

### Task 7

No answer needed for the task.

When intercepting the request that was earlier used to send a mail to WebWolf and
changing the target address to `idont@exist.welp`, the reponse looks like this:

```text
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Connection: close
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Frame-Options: DENY
Content-Type: application/json
Date: Mon, 09 Oct 2023 18:50:57 GMT

{
  "lessonCompleted" : false,
  "feedback" : "Of course you can send mail to user idont however you will not be able to read this e-mail in WebWolf, please use your own username.",
  "output" : null,
  "assignment" : "MailAssignment",
  "attemptWasMade" : false
}
```

### Task 10

No answer needed.

## Developer Tools

### Task 1

No answer needed.

### Task 2

No answer needed.


### Task 3

No answer needed.

### Task 4

Use the console in the dev tools and call the javascript function webgoat.customjs.phoneHome().

The answer for this question is randomly generated each time the function is called.
Simply open your browsers developer console and run it to receive the result.

![Developer Tools Task 4](./.img/dev_tools_t4.png)

### Task 5

No answer needed.

### Task 6

In this assignment you need to find a specific HTTP request and read a randomized number from it.

Open the "Network" tab in your browsers developer tools and take a look at the request
body of the request. Note, that this answer is also randomly generated each time the request is send.

No answer needed.

> TODO: Task 7, Page 10 of assignment -> I don't get the question

### Task 5

1. *How could an intruder harm the security goal of confidentiality?*

Solution 3: By stealing a database where names and emails are stored and uploading it to a website.

2. *How could an intruder harm the security goal of integrity?*

Solution 1: By changing the names and emails of one or more users stored in a database.

3. *How could an intruder harm the security goal of availability?*

Solution 4: By launching a denial of service attack on the servers.

4. *What happens if at least one of the CIA security goals is harmed?*

Solution 2: The system's security is compromised even if only one goal is harmed.

## Crypto Basics

### Task 1

No answer needed.

### Task 2

If you have no Linux terminal available, you can decode the string here: [CyberChef - Github.io](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/)

Otherwise, you can use the following command:

```bash
echo "bGVhc3RzaWduaWZpY2FudGJpdDpwYXNzd29yZA==" | base64 -d
```

The answer will be the credentials of the logged in user.
For this example the string will decode to:

```text
leastsignificantbit:password
```

Base64 works by taking any binary input and splitting it into a 6-bit character representation.
Usually, this is used when it is necessary to transfer binary files like images via text,
but it has also been adapted for encoding of large junks of text data, like cookies or some
headers in HTTP/S requests.

However, Base64 has one flaw: If the original size of the binary data is not a multiple
of three, there may be some empty bytes.
This is solved by appending enough empty bytes to the end of the input
to pad the data to a 3-byte-multiple.
Since empty bytes cannot be natively encoded with Base64, they are represented through
`=` signs at the end of the encoded data.

HTTP Basic Authentication uses Base64 encoding to transfer a clients credentials
through a request header called `Authorization`.
This header contains the credentials in the following format:

```text
<username>:<password>
```

This is then encoded and prepended with the string "Basic" to let the server know what type of
authorization is used. A full header would look like this:

```text
Authorization: Basic eW91d2lzaHRoaXN3YXNteXBhc3N3b3JkOmJ1dG5vcGUK
```

### Task 3

The following string needs to be decoded:

```text
{xor}Oz4rPj0+LDovPiwsKDAtOw==
```

Apart from the `{xor}`, this seems to be encoded with `base64`.
Using the command from *Task 2*, it decodes to:

```text
;>+>=>,:/>,,(0-;
```

The `{xor}` may be a hint to how this string is encoded.
It is possible to brute force XOR encoded strings using [CyberChef - Github.io](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/).

The string decodes to:

```text
databasepassword
```

![Crypto Basics Task 3](./.img/crypt_basics_t3.png)

When storing passwords using XOR, the key is repeated until it fits the length of the input.
This lengthened key is then XORed with this input to create the cipher.

XOR is a very simple encoding that simply compares both strings bit by bit and outputs `1` if the bits are *not* equal and `0` if they are.

| Input Bit | Key Bit | Output Bit |
|-----------|---------|------------|
| 0         | 0       | 0          |
| 0         | 1       | 1          |
| 1         | 0       | 1          |
| 1         | 1       | 0          |
